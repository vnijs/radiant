> Summarize and explore your data

Generate summary statistics for one or more variables in your data. The most powerful feature in Explore is that you can easy describe the data _by_ one or more other variables and create corresponding plots.

For example, if we select `price` from the `diamonds` dataset we can see the number of observations (n), the mean, the median, etc. etc. However,  the mean price for each clarity level of the diamond can also be easily provided by choosing `clarity` as the Group by variable.

#### Filter

Use the `Filter` box to select (or omit) specific sets of rows from the data. See the helpfile for Data > View for details.
