> How correlated are the variables in the data?

Create a correlation matrix of the selected variables. Correlations and p-values are provided for each variable pair. To show only those correlations above a certain (absolute) level, use the correlation cutoff box.

![Summary](http://mostly-harmless.github.io/radiant/quant/figures_quant/correlation_summary.png)

A visual representation of the correlation matrix is provided in the Plot tab.

Stars shown in the Plot tab are interpreted as:

- p.value between 0 and 0.001:  ***
- p.value between 0.001 and 0.01: **
- p.value between 0.01 and 0.05: *
- p.value between 0.05 and 0.1: .

The font-size used in the plot is proportional to the size and significance of the correlation between two variables.
